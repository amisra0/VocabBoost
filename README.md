# WordBank
Learning a new language and wish you had a way to learn words better? Stuck in a confusing Greek myth class whose verbose online reading assignments leave you with a million different names you forget about each time? Wishing you could boast the vocabulary of the authors of the books and articles you read? Well all those problems, and more, can be solved by WordBank.
Simply install this chrome extension by downloading the files, load the unpacked extension, as explained by Google Chrome's official instructions on how to upload a local extension. Then, whenever you right click a word, you will have the option to "WordBank It!" where you will then see a sidepanel with all definitions of the word according to Merriam Webster Dictionary, and you can store it once you type in whatever definition/note you wish to associate with that word.
This note you store with the word can be whatever you'd like- a word in your native language, an example of how the word was used, or one of the definitions pulled up.
Happy WordBanking!
